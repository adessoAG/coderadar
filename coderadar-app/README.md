# Coderadar UI

## Starting the app

The project uses Angular CLI.

You can install the needed dependencies by running `npm install` in the project root.
The app can then be started by running `ng serve` in the root folder and going to `localhost:4200` in a web browser. (A Coderadar server must be running on `localhost:8080` for the app to function)
