[introduction]
== Introduction

This guide is intended for administrators and developers who want to get a coderadar server up and running.

== Starting a coderadar server

== Configuration Parameters

== Clustering

== Monitoring

Coderadar makes use of http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring Boot Actuator],
which provides a mechanism to expose certain metrics via HTTP. A list of the monitoring endpoints can by default be accessed via
"/actuator" on each server node in a coderadar cluster.

=== Securing Access to Monitoring
Most monitoring endpoints are protected by a basic authentication. The username and password for this authentication
has to be configured via the config parameters `security.user.name` and `security.user.password` (see chapter <<Configuration Parameters>>).

=== Coderadar-specific Monitoring Metrics

Coderadar exposes the following metrics via the "/metrics" endpoint. Note that the metrics will only be listed
once a certain action has taken place, so if the metric is not listed you can interpret it as "never occurred".

.Coderadar Monitoring Metrics
|===
|Metric name |Description

| counter.coderadar.jobs.jobAcquisitionConflicts
| The number of times that two server nodes tried to acquire the same job from the waiting job queue and thus
  failed acquiring a waiting job. When this happens, the server nodes automatically retry after a couple seconds.
  As long as this number does not grow faster than the sum of successfully finished jobs, there shouldn't be
  a problem.

| gauge.coderadar.jobs.<JOB_TYPE>.inProgress
| 1 if a job of the given type is currently running, 0 if not.

| counter.coderadar.jobs.<JOB_TYPE>.success
| Number of successfully processed jobs of the given type.

| counter.coderadar.jobs.<JOB_TYPE>.failed
| Number of failed jobs of the given type.

| gauge.coderadar.jobs.currentJobStartTime
| Timestamp of the start of the job that is currently being processed by this server node (milliseconds since epoch).
  -1 if no job is currently being processed.
