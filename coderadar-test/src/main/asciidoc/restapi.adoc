[introduction]
== Introduction

// TODO schreibweise von coderadar-Begriffen (Project, FilePattern, Module, ..) und Fachbegriffen (refresh token, ..)

coderadar server is a tool for continuous source code analysis. This document describes the REST API of coderadar.
The REST API may for example be accessed by the following clients:

* applications that provide a user interface for coderadar (like coderadar's own user interface)
* third-party applications or tools that want to integrate data provided by coderadar

This guide is aimed at developers of such applications.

=== Usage of HTTP Verbs

The following table describes how the coderadar API interprets the HTTP verbs.

.HTTP Verbs
|===
|HTTP Verb | Usage

|GET
|GET is used to retrieve information.

|POST
|POST is used to create and update resources.

|DELETE
|DELETE is used to delete resources.

|PUT
|PUT is not used at this time.

|PATCH
|PATCH is not used at this time.
|===

anchor:usage-of-get[]
[NOTE]
=====
.Usage of GET
If a GET request requires parameters, they can usually be
provided as parameters encoded in the URL. However, in some cases parameters are too unwieldy to
encode them in the URL. In these cases the parameters are expected as JSON string within the request
body. Since some tools don't allow GET requests with a body, coderadar accepts the POST method in
these cases as well.
=====

=== Error Handling

==== Successful Requests

Successful requests return a response with HTTP status 200 (OK) or 201 (CREATED) and contain a JSON structure in the response
body if applicable.

==== Validation Errors

POST requests against the coderadar API usually expect a JSON structure in the request body. If the JSON structure
contains values that are invalid, the API returns a response with HTTP status 400 (bad request) that contains
an error JSON structure object that looks like this:

include::{snippets}/projects/create/error400/http-response.adoc[]

==== General Errors

If some unexpected error occurs during the processing of a request, the API returns a response with HTTP status 500
(internal server error).

== User Management
anchor:chapter-configure[]
This section describes the REST endpoints for managing coderadar users.

=== Loading a User

[discrete]
==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/users/get/http-request.adoc[]

[discrete]
==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/users/get/http-response.adoc[]

=== Listing all Users

[discrete]
===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/users/list/http-request.adoc[]

[discrete]
===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/users/list/http-response.adoc[]

=== Authentication
To access the functionality of coderadar you have to register a user.
You need to define a username and a password. The password will be sent as
plain text and hashed on server side for persisting.

==== Registering a User

===== Registration Data Structure
include::{snippets}/user/registration/request-fields.adoc[]

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/user/registration/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/user/registration/http-response.adoc[]

==== Loading a User

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/users/get/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/users/get/http-response.adoc[]

==== Login
anchor:login[]
A user has to log in to use other endpoints of coderadar.
If the log in is successful, user obtains two JSON Web Tokens https://jwt.io

* an access token
* a refresh token.

How to use the tokens is described in <<authentication, Authentication>>

===== Login Data Structure
include::{snippets}/user/auth/request-fields.adoc[]

===== Example Request
include::{snippets}/user/auth/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response
include::{snippets}/user/auth/http-response.adoc[]

==== Token Refresh
anchor:refresh[]
To get a new access token after the current token has been expired you have
to use the refresh token you got after successful login

===== Login Data Structure
include::{snippets}/user/refresh/request-fields.adoc[]

===== Example Request
include::{snippets}/user/refresh/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response
include::{snippets}/user/refresh/http-response.adoc[]

==== Password Change
To change the password user has to be authenticated by the access token
and has to send a new password and th–µ refresh token to the server. The user will be found by the
refresh token and his refresh tokens will be revoked so the user has to log in with the username and password
again after the current access token is expired.

===== Data Structure
include::{snippets}/user/password/change/request-fields.adoc[]

===== Example Request
include::{snippets}/user/password/change/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response
include::{snippets}/user/password/change/http-response.adoc[]

anchor:authentication[]

==== Authentication
After a user registered, he or she can start working with coderadar.
The first step is login. To log in in coderadar use the <<login, Login>> endpoint. The user must use the username and the password
specified at registration. If the login was successful user gets two JSON Web Tokens (see https://jwt.io):

* an access token and
* a refresh token.

After that the user has to use the access token for authentication with each request to a protected route or resource.
The tokens are signed by the server so the server can validate the signature of the token to grant the access to resources.
The access token is a Base64 encoded String, that must be added to Authorization HTTP header like this:

 Authorization:eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJjb2RlcmFkYXIiLCJleHAiOjE0ODQ1MTUzOTUsInR5cGUiOiJSRUZSRVNIIiwiaWF0IjoxNDg0NTE1NDU1LCJ1c2VySWQiOiIxIiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJyYWRhciJ9.zfkyc5jkPiAUEt7nU25SJxKprcPiXaiq0Q6bCJ_RrQo

The access token is short-lived and by default expires after 15 minutes.
When the access token expires, the user has to require a new access token. It can be done with the refresh token
user got as response after login. The refresh token must be sent with a request to the <<refresh, Token Refresh>> endpoint.
The refresh token is long-lived and by default expires after 60 days.
When the refresh token expired or was revoked for example after a password change,
a user has to login again to get a new refresh token.

A typical work flow looks like this:

. Client logs in with username and password and gets two tokens
. Client requires resources using the access token in each request
. After 15 minutes client gets a 401-Response
. Clients tries to get a new access token using refresh token
. Clients gets a new access token and can request further resources
. If the client can't get a new access token using the refresh token, client has to login again with username and password.

== Configuring a Project
anchor:chapter-configure[]

This section describes the resources you can interact with to configure a project to be analyzed by coderadar.
To run an analysis on a project, you have to at least follow these steps:

. <<creating-a-project, Create a Project>> so that coderadar knows where to get the code base. Once this step
  is done, coderadar will clone the repository and create some metadata on the commits and code base. Depending
  on the size of the project, it may take a while to complete.
. <<setting-filepatterns, Define File Patterns>> to tell coderadar which files should be analyzed. If this step
  is omitted, an analysis will provide no results.
. <<create-analyzer, Add at least one analyzer>> to your project. Each added analyzer will run over the
  files specified in the previous step and provide some code metrics.
. <<start-analysis, Start an Analyzing Job>> for your project. coderadar will start to analyze all files
  in the commits between startDate and endDate using the analyzers you have configured. Depending on the size
  of the code base and the number of configured analyzers, this may take some time to finish.

=== Project

A project defines some metadata about the project you want coderadar to analyze. With a project resource
and its sub-resources you provide coderadar with the information it needs to analyze the source code.

=== Modules
anchor:chapter-modules[]
Source code is usually arranged within multiple modules that each contains a set of source files.
Using the following REST endpoints, you can provide coderadar with information about the modules within
your codebase. Each module simply is a path into the VCS codebase. All files that are within that path
are considered to be part of the module.

Please note that the operations to create, update and delete modules may take some time to be finished since all
files in all commits have to be updated during these operations.

==== Listing available Analyzers

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/analyzer/list/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/analyzer/list/http-response.adoc[]

== Querying Project Data
anchor:chapter-query-project-data[]

This section describes the resources that are attached to a project and are only available in the context of a
project.

=== Metric

The Metric resource describes a metric that an analyzer configured in your project provides.

==== Listing available Metrics

You can list all metrics that have been measured for your project by calling the request below.

[NOTE]
=====
Metric values will become available as soon as an <<start-analysis,analysis>> starts for your project.
At that moment, analysis of each commit in the date range starts The date range is set in the project
settings. The project will only be regarded in this date range. Depending on how many commits that are and how
many analyzers are configured, analysis will take a while.
=====

===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/metrics/list/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/metrics/list/http-response.adoc[]

=== Commit

The Commit resource contains some metadata about a commit to your project's version control system. Commits
will become available as soon as you have created a project and provided valid VCS credentials (see <<creating-a-project,Creating a Project>>).
Depending of the number of commits you have in your project, it may take a while until all commits
are available.
